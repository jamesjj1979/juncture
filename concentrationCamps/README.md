# A brief overveiw of The atrosity of the holocost in WW2

## The beginning of the war

The Holocaust was Nazi Germany’s deliberate,
organized, state-sponsored persecution and
machinelike murder of approximately six
million European Jews and at least five million
prisoners of war, Romany, Jehovah’s Witnesses,
homosexuals, and other victims. Holocaust is a
word of Greek origin. It means “burnt offering.”

## somwthing

Anti-Semitism was a centuries-long
phenomenon in Europe, but it reached
its height in Germany during the Nazi era
(1933–1945). The Nazis also claimed that
Romany (Gypsies), Slavs (Poles, Russians),
and physically and mentally disabled people
were Untermenschen (subhuman) and did not
deserve to live.

On assuming power as absolute ruler of the
German state, Hitler began a systematic
campaign to strip Jews of their property and
their jobs in academia, the judiciary, the
military, and the civil service. Synagogues were
defiled and burned. Jewish businesses were
boycotted or shut down. The Nuremburg Laws
of 1935 denied Jews their German citizenship,
forbade Jews to marry non-Jews, and took away
most of their political rights. Jews became
scapegoats for everything awful that had
happened to Germany over the previous several
decades: inflation, economic depression, the
loss of World War I, and the punitive Treaty of
Versailles. “No salvation is possible,” Hitler had
told his followers in 1922, “until the bearer of
disunion, the Jew, has been rendered powerless
to harm.”

During a Nazi-provoked riot known as
Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) on
November 9, 1938, at least 267 synagogues
were destroyed. At least 91 people were
murdered. Countless Jewish businesses and
homes were vandalized and destroyed, and
30,000 Jews were sent to Dachau, Buchenwald,
Sachsenhausen, and other concentration
camps. It became difficult for Jews to leave
Germany because few countries, including the
United States, were willing to take them in,
even though it was widely known that they were
suffering horribly under the Nazis. 
When Hitler began his march of conquest
in 1939, Jews in countries under the fascist
heel, beginning with heavily Jewish Poland,
were herded into unsanitary ghettos, walledoff sections of the city where they were denied
proper food, medical services, and heat.
Starvation and disease killed hundreds of
thousands of Jews in Warsaw and Lodz, two
of the largest ghettoes in Poland. Many Jews
escaped the ghetto and went into hiding, often
relying on the kindness and bravery of nonJewish friends. To hide a Jew was to put one’s 
life, and the lives of one’s family, at risk. If
caught, those hiding Jews were imprisoned or
shot. Few Jews were able to survive the war
in hiding. Like German-born Anne Frank and
her family, who spent much of the war hiding
in Amsterdam, they were usually found and
shipped off to concentration camps.

## During the middle of the war

In January 1942, high-ranking Nazi Party
officials met secretly in the Berlin suburb of
Wannsee to formulate plans for “the Final
Solution of the Jewish question.” Hundreds
of thousands of Jews were already in Nazi
concentrations camps serving as slave laborers
for the German war effort. After the Wannsee
Conference, the Nazis began large-scale
deportations from the ghettos. Victims were
herded together at train stations, loaded onto
cattle cars, and taken—unknown to them—to
extermination camps, killing centers in Poland
with specially designed gassing facilities.
Auschwitz, Treblinka, Chelmno and other SSrun camps employed industrial-style killing,
using a pesticide designed to kill rats. The old,
the very young, and the physically weak—those
unable to work—were killed first. When the
strong grew weak and unable to work they were
 exterminated. But by mid-1943, almost all
Jews who arrived at a death camp were put to
death immediately. Charlotte Weiss recalled that
when she arrived at Auschwitz in 1944 with
her sisters, they saw mountains of eyeglasses,
shoes, and clothing belonging to the victims.
“We were shaking,” she said. “We knew the end
was not going to be good.”

There were valorous efforts to resist the
Holocaust. A number of armed uprisings in
the ghettos and camps surprised the Nazis,
but all were put down with fanatical brutality.
Some Jews escaped ghettos and joined partisan
movements fighting against the Nazis from
forest enclaves. Within the ghettos and the
killing camps, acts of defiance, small or large,
were suppressed and the brave dissidents
savagely punished.

## By the end of the war
When the Allies began to close in on Germany
in late 1944 and early 1945, the Nazis forced
the surviving prisoners on long marches
to camps believed to be out of the way of
the advancing enemy armies. Hundreds
of thousands died of exposure, violence,
and starvation on these death marches. As
the Allied armies moved into Germany and
Poland, they liberated the concentration and
extermination camps, and witnesses to these
scenes—war reporters and military personnel—
were horrified by what they found. The world
already knew the Germans were gassing,
or working to death, Jews and other ethnic
victims in these camps. Escaped prisoners
had reported conditions to the media and to
government officials in the United Kingdom and
the United States. But it wasn’t until the camps
were liberated that the full horror of Nazi crimes
was exposed to the world.
